opening_description = [
    # Simple Openings
    "The point is to control the center quickly with your pawn and knight and then put your bishop on its most dangerous square. You are also preparing to castle to safety.",
    "The French Defense is one of the first strategic openings every chess player should learn. After e5 (now or later), both sides will have pawn chains. One risk of the French Defense is that the c8-bishop can be very hard to develop.",
    "The Ruy Lopez is one of the oldest and most classic of all openings. It is named after a Spanish bishop who wrote one of the first books on chess. The Ruy Lopez attacks the knight which defends the e5-pawn. White hopes to use this attack to build more pressure on Black's central pawn.",
    # Intermediate Openings
    "The Queen's Gambit is a chess opening that starts with the moves 1.d4 and 2.c4. It is one of the oldest known chess openings and was analyzed in the 17th century. The Queen's Gambit is a chess opening where White offers a pawn sacrifice for rapid development and control of the center.",
    "The Sicilian Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves 1.e4 c5. The Sicilian Defense is the most popular choice of aggressive players with the black pieces. The Sicilian Defense is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4.",
    "The King's Indian Defense is a chess opening played by Black against 1.d4. Black plays to control the center with his pawn on d6 and his knight on f6, and then fianchetto his dark-squared bishop on the kingside. The opening is a solid defense that is difficult to break down.",
    # Advanced Openings
    "The Queen's Gambit Declined is a chess opening in which Black declines a pawn offered by White in the Queen's Gambit by playing e6. It is a solid opening that aims to maintain a strong pawn structure and create counterplay opportunities.",
    "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move 1.c4. It is named after the English player Howard Staunton, who played it in the 19th century. The English Opening is a flexible and solid opening that can transpose into many other openings. It aims to control the center with a pawn on c4 and a knight on c3, while also preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop.",
    "The Catalan Opening is a chess opening where White adopts a combination of the Queen's Gambit and RÃ©ti Opening. White plays d4 and c4 and fianchettoes the white bishop on g2. It is a solid and flexible opening for White that can lead to rich middlegame positions with chances for both sides."
